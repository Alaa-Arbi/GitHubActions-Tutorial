# GitHubActions-Tutorial
This is a repo, in which I track learning about GitHubActions

CI/CD steps recommendations:
- Ensure the code passes all unit tests.
- Perform code quality and compliance checks to make sure the source code meets the organization's standards.
- Check the code and its dependencies for known security issues.
- Build the code by integrating new source code from (potentially) multiple contributors.
- Ensure the software passes integration tests.
- Specify the version of the new build.
- Deliver the new binaries to the appropriate filesystem location.
- Deploy the new binaries to one or more servers.
- Determine if any of these tasks don't pass, and report the issue to the proper individual or team for resolution.
